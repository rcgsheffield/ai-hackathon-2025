NE/F011210/1,"Arctic sea ice is at present on track to achieve a record minimum in extent during September 2007. While solar energy input to the ocean through openings in the sea ice is accelerating the melting process, there is another potentially important source of heat in the near-surface layer of the ocean. Historically, this layer of warm water of Atlantic Ocean origin has been isolated from the surface sea ice by an intermediate layer of low salinity water. During the 1990's the salinity of that layer increased significantly and the barrier to upward heat penetration became weaker at a time of increased temperature of the Atlantic water layer. We hypothesize that variability in the temperature and salinity of these upper layers of the Arctic Ocean, notably warming of the Atlantic layer and salinification (or weakening) of the overlying cold halocline, will result in enhanced upward heat fluxes which can significantly impact the rates of melting or freezing of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. We propose to quantify the effects of variations in the upper ocean temperature and salinity on vertical heat flux by measuring the turbulent heat flux beneath autonomous buoys that will be deployed on drifting Arctic sea ice during the International Polar Year. As part of the UK International Polar Year (IPY) contribution to a growing integrated Arctic Ocean Observing System (iAOOS), the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) will build and deploy in 2008 two ice-tethered profilers (ITPs) of their own design under NERC funding of the Arctic Synoptic Basin-wide Oceanography (ASBO) project. Over the course of their 1-2 year lifetimes, these ITPs will drift across the central Arctic Ocean basins with the sea ice on which they were deployed, relaying back in near-real time temperature and salinity data from the upper layers of the ocean waters over which the sea ice has drifted. As presently designed, and with the existing NERC ASBO support, the SAMS ITPs will resolve the vertical structure and horizontal extent of the important upper-ocean water masses. We propose to augment the SAMS ITPs with fast-response temperature sensors to measure turbulent temperature fluctuations and to determine the vertical heat flux through the upper ocean layers along the ITP Arctic drift paths. Fast-response thermistors are the standard sensors for measuring oceanic temperature signatures of mixing, and have been employed for many years on ship-based profiling turbulence packages. In recent years, fast-response thermistors have been mounted on profiling floats and moorings. The proposed work will be a new application of this well-established measurement technique, and as such represents an advance in measurement capability for the iAOOS during the IPY. The ITPs will be deployed on the Canadian side of the Lomonosov Ridge in the mean path of the trans-polar ice drift, and will thus yield measurements along trajectories that cross the major ridge systems and upper ocean currents of the Eurasian Basin. These will be first basin-scale measurements of turbulent fluctuations through the upper ocean structure (mixed layer, cold halocline, and Atlantic water) in the Arctic Ocean, and as such will vastly increase the areal coverage of data on mixing in the Arctic, as well as yield new insight into the impacts of variability of the upper ocean on overall heat budget of the Arctic, including the impact on sea-ice melting and growth.",NERC
EP/Y031962/1,"Synchrotron radiation (SR) sources provide brilliant beams of light by accelerating electrons at high energies around a circular magnetic lattice. The resulting X-rays provide a uniquely powerful tool in the exploration of structure, composition and excitations in materials. 

XMaS is an integral part of the UK's synchrotron radiation (SR) infrastructure and has been supporting UK materials scientists since it began operations at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in 1997. Following the recently completed ESRF upgrade, XMaS has undergone extensive modifications to deliver a state-of-the-art facility fully exploiting the capabilities of the new machine. It delivers a much more brilliant X-ray beam with an operational energy range from 2.1 to 40 keV. The upgraded facility is more versatile, providing a combination of techniques from X-ray diffraction to small angle X-ray scattering as well as X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Due to the close engagement with users in co-developing and refining sample environments the scientific areas addressed on XMaS are broad and interdisciplinary. The science portfolio on XMaS continues to evolve, embracing a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines under the generic theme of materials science, cutting across research in physics, chemistry, biosciences, healthcare, engineering, and energy. XMaS provides access to tender X-ray spectroscopy (2-4 keV), which is very uncommon and in high demand, especially for application to materials such as batteries and catalysts as well as in heritage and environmental research. The new high energy capability (25-40 keV) opens up operando experiments as well as accessing technologically important X-ray absorption edges. The same sample volume is measured across an extensive energy range and within the same sample environment. This enables real time reactions to be followed on a site-by-site basis and help develop new materials to accelerate the delivery of NetZero 2050. Combined X-ray metrologies and simultaneous measurements of sample properties allow the function-structure relationship to be explored across a wide range of length and time scales. It is by building on these new capabilities, that XMaS is able to deliver the correlative characterisation that is needed to understand ever more complex and heterogeneous materials and devices under technologically relevant conditions.

XMaS is an enabling tool, and is an essential part of the UK research infrastructure for material science ensuring that UK researchers have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation, expertise and techniques now and into the future. XMaS provides an essential layer of capacity and unique capabilities. In addition, by training students and early career researchers, XMaS provides highly skilled individuals to the wider materials research base. Partnerships with national research centres and international collaborators ensure the future competitiveness, resilience and creativity of the UK materials sector which relies on the development, characterisation, and exploitation of novel functional materials. The balance of science on XMaS will encompass both long-term discovery-led research as well as shorter term impact-focused research thereby providing an environment for transformative, challenge-led material science research.",EPSRC
EP/J000469/1,"The aim of this project is to design and demonstrate novel non-volatile and extremely low-power logic systems by hybridizing the newly developed three-terminal metal oxide device, Atom Transistor and nano-electro-mechanical (NEM) systems for future beyond von Neumann computing. The hybrid systems are investigated theoretically and experimentally using world-leading nanotechnologies of the NIMS team in Japan and the Southampton team in the UK. The operation of the systems is studied both on the device and circuit levels by using a multi-scale hybrid modelling. Basic circuits such as inverters and power management systems are designed utilizing the unique characteristics of the Atom Transistors and NEM switches. The duality of volatile and non-volatile operations of the Atom Transistors enables to design a new type of non-volatile logic systems which is similar to neurons in the brain. A novel bistable sleep transistor is also designed based on the recently developed suspended-gate silicon nanodot memory (SGSNM) technology for advanced power management architectures. Prototyping the systems is carried out jointly by transferring samples as well as technologies between the two teams, and electrical testing the circuits is conducted using state-of-the-art characterization tools at Southampton Nanofabrication Centre. The first demonstration of the revolutionary non-volatile logic systems towards information technology in the next generation will provide opportunities to companies for further development and commercialisation in both Japan and the UK. This will thereafter contribute to further enhance the existing economic relations between the two countries as well as strengthening their economies.",EPSRC
AH/D001560/1,"The study of reading and reception as social phenomena is now central to our understanding of literature, history and culture. It has become an established field within Book History. Scottish Readers Remember represents the first sustained and focused attempt to record the reading experiences of Scots in the twentieth century and, from them, to analyse not only changing tastes, practices, and habits but also the contribution of reading to an individual and collective sense of identity. Transcribed interviews, spread across communities in Scotland, will form the core of evidence and will be complemented by use of archival and other sources. Historical studies of previous centuries have obviously depended upon documentary sources and the opportunity to provide an oral archive from which a complementary study of the twentieth century could be written is timely.\n \nIndeed, reading once represented a large gap in our knowledge of social history, particularly reading as a factor in working-class experience. The gap has been narrowed for the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by Professor Jonathan Rose and others drawing on a wealth of memoirs, autobiographies and diaries. A quantitative balance has been provided by the use of library and other records such as in the RGU-based study of Edzell Public Library. However, this project will also record the reading memories of the generation that is now in its 60s and above. The memories of this generation are at risk of loss due to increasing age. There is no such coherent archive of reading experiences in Scotland or indeed the UK; the study of twentieth-century reading that will be largely based on it will be a pioneer in furthering understanding of this key activity in terms of personal and social development.",AHRC
NE/S016015/1,"Given the economic, social and environmental value of the marine environment it makes sense to manage it in a way that ensures long term sustainability of both ecosystems and human uses. We can only do this if we understand the impact that human activities and management practises have on marine systems, including people. 
Spatial management measures such as fishery closures, marine protected areas and marine plans have emerged as a core component of the UK's marine management portfolio. In essence, spatial management aims to incorporate the diversity of human uses, consider the compatibility of different activities, and balance use with the impacts of these activities on biodiversity and people. Yet despite the extensive use of spatial management, substantial gaps in understanding exist regarding how to monitor the impacts of spatial management measures and evaluate their effectiveness across environmental, social and economic outcomes.

Our research aims to systematically bring together the available evidence on existing and emerging environmental, social and economic techniques for monitoring the effects of spatial management measures and evaluating their effectiveness. In particular we will focus on examples from countries with a coastline and in a similar socio-economic and political context to the UK. By clearly and transparently describing this evidence, we will be able to explore understanding surrounding methods for how to monitor and evaluate spatial management measures, and inform the development of guidelines and future monitoring and evaluation practises across the UK.

Our findings, in the form of a database, will be published alongside an article in the open-access journal Environmental Evidence, providing a highly accessible, freely available summary of the evidence. We will also produce a one-page policy summary, to disseminate our results to decision-makers, and a set of guidelines for use to facilitate application of our database. By making these outputs publicly available and easy to use we will give our work a lasting legacy beyond the life of the project. For example, researchers will be able to easily update and build on our database as desired or design research to fill evidence gaps, and decision-makers will be able to easily locate evidence of relevance to inform their monitoring and management activities. We will involve key stakeholders through our Stakeholder Group in the design of our project and discuss our results with them to ensure they are used to help inform spatial management in the UK.

The evidence base collated within this project is anticipated to benefit a wide range of sectors and users of the marine environment, as well as nature conservation and academic research. These benefits will extend beyond the UK to international policy audiences facing similar challenges in determining the impact of their spatial management activities. Our extended review team demonstrates the interdisciplinarity nature of this project being composed of researchers specialising in marine and fisheries management from environmental, social, economic and policy perspectives based across academic and charitable institutions. Our existing Stakeholder Group attests to the value of this project with support from: the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), Marine Scotland Science (MSS), Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCAs), and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). We will seek to extend our Stakeholder Group to incorporate all of the UK Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies during the project programme.

NC/R001162/1,"Liver cancer, classified into 2 main entities, Hepatocellularcarcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma, is the 3rd cause of cancer death worldwide and its incidence is increasing due to co-funding factors such as obesity and life-style (e.g. alcoholism). The primary management of liver cancer is mainly restricted to surgical removal of the tumour. Unfortunately, few patients can benefit from it as, at the diagnostic time, the tumour has already spread and metastized. This is particularly the case for Cholangiocarcinomas, which are the most aggressive and with the poorest prognosis. When tumour resection is not an option, patients are left with little therapeutic options, which mainly rely on the use of clinically approved compounds such as sorafenib. However, this treatments have little efficacy as liver cancer is a very heterogenous entity, where the spectre of tumour mutations makes each patient's tumour an almost individual entity. Therefore, liver cancer would extremely benefit from personalized treatments instead of one-fits-all therapeutic approaches. 
To develop personalized treatments for liver cancer, at present, both industry and academics rely on Patient derived tumour xenografts (PDXs), which require the patient's tumour to be implanted into a mouse host. While these are very good models that retain all the histological, genetic and transcriptomic features of the patient's original tumour, they are not suitable to most of the patients as usually they fail to develop and, if they do, they are not amenable to test &gt;5 drugs, as they require many animals and resources.
A good alternative would be to be able to grow and expand the patient's primary tumour directly on a dish. To be a good and suitable model, these primary cultures should be expandable while it should retain the characteristics of the patient's tumour and be amenable for large drug screening (at least 20 coumpounds). However, up to now, these human liver cancer in vitro cultures have yet to be developed.
We have recently shown that human liver cancer cells can be expanded long-term from biospies of human donors and can be used to model human liver Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, a rare monogenic disease of the liver. Therefore, in this proposal, we aim at translating our organoid culture system from modelling human liver biology in homeostasis to modelling human liver cancer in vitro. 

Therefore, our aim is to develop, characterize and validate primary liver cancer organoid cultures and prove the relevance in terms of similarity to the original patient's tissue as well as their applicability as platform for anti-cancer drug testing for future personalized medicine approaches for liver cancer patients. Also, because we will be studying human liver cancer tissue directly we believe that our culture system will result in the future replacement of animal models, and specially PDXs, for drug screening tests for human liver cancer personalized approaches.",NC3Rs
NE/V002937/1,"Trees play an essential role in sustaining life, providing wildlife habitats and timber and storing carbon, helping to reduce climate change. Tree cover accounts for around 17% of the land area of Great Britain, but trees across the UK landscape, in both woodlands and urban or agricultural environments (the 'treescape'), are currently at risk due to a range of pests and diseases, many of which result in eventual tree death or cause safety hazards due to dead hanging branches or increased risk of tree fall. For example, ash dieback, a disease which arrived in the UK in 2012, could lead to the loss of 90% of the UK's ash trees, currently one of the most common broadleaf species. This project will work with key partners with responsibility for managing trees or ensuring public safety, including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Network Rail and Norfolk County Council, to develop a monitoring system, which can ultimately be established across the UK treescape, in locations likely to provide an early warning of pest and disease spread (such as near ports or along roads and railways), or of importance for conservation, cultural reasons or public safety, to provide a 'sentinel' system of changes in the health of trees. 

The monitoring system, to be deployed in Norfolk, UK, will combine observations from sensors attached to individual trees in the landscape (measuring the condition of the tree canopy, movement of water, tree growth and the motion of the trunk as an indicator of risk of tree fall) with visual observations of tree health made by networks of voluntary 'citizen scientists', including current Tree Council Tree Wardens. Images obtained from cameras on drones and satellites will be used to expand the observations across a wider area and modelling methods will be used to combine the data from these different sources to estimate tree health and detect changes. 

A web-based interface will be developed to provide both volunteers and partners with accessible and easily interpreted information from sensors and models, and the experiences of volunteers of working with the technology will be explored through workshops. Models will also be developed to explore the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of different designs of sensor networks and to identify the ideal combinations of and distribution of sensors and observations for future use in monitoring larger areas and more locations. Workshops with partners and other interested stakeholders (e.g. forestry industry representatives or conservation organisations) will be used to examine the best ways in which sensor technology and model outputs can be communicated and the role such data can play in the decision-making processes. The demonstration network, representing a digital environment for tree health assessment and monitoring, will provide a blueprint for future deployment throughout the UK, leading to improved understanding of the spread of pests and diseases and better management of trees.",UKRI
ES/J01172X/1,"This project will show QM trainers how to encourage social science undergraduates (UGs) in many subject areas to engage with, use and re-use numeric evidence both wisely and appropriately. The project has assembled a team of international design experts to work with a large number of UG social science methods trainers in seven major UK universities. Together they will all prepare template course materials that link research designs to methods of quantitative data collection and analysis, and adapt these templates for use in their own subject areas. In this way, research design can be embedded in the teaching of undergraduate quantitative methods, through provision of training for current and future providers. The renewed emphasis on design at the outset of a study, currently rather neglected in UK researcher development, will have a number of immediate and longer-term benefits. It discourages schismic thinking among UGs since designs are largely independent of specific methods of data collection. It encourages true prediction and forethought in collecting data for new studies. It encourages the correct choice of methods of analysis for data that have already been collected. Above all, it holds the promise of simplifying analysis to such an extent that undergraduates may not even be aware that they are, in fact, working with 'quantitative' methods. 

The applicants and their team of experts and hosts are internationally-renowned methods experts who specialise in QM design, as well as being professionally-recognised and lauded adult educators. This combined expertise, together with the close engagement of trainers in QM in undergraduate teaching, will fill a major gap in UK social science QM teaching. International experts will prepare a wide range of resources and materials to show how design naturally and easily underpins the teaching of QM, accessible to undergraduates across all areas of social science. Although the focus will be on undergraduate teaching, we will build into our programme of events a progression from introductory through intermediate and to advanced training in order to up-skill QM teachers in the embedding of design at all levels. This will enable a step-change in teaching at undergraduate level and even beyond. The work programme of up-skilling of research methods trainers includes the creation of support and curricular materials tailored to all relevant areas, sustained collaborative development of materials and approaches, and delivery of intensive clinics UK-wide. THe materials will be trialled in practice in social science UG teaching among the seven HEIs involved, and ideally more widely by the end of the project. The project is led by the College of Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham. It will be delivered in co-operation with the Universities of Cardiff, Leicester, Manchester, Nottingham, Warwick and York, and will involve experts from US Northwestern University.",ESRC
EP/P034160/1,"New developments in Quantum Technology have resulted in the ability to cool atoms close to absolute zero using lasers. At these extreme temperatures, laboratory experiments have shown that these cold atoms can be used as ultra-sensitive sensors for measuring gravity. The objective of this project is to take the technology out of the laboratory and build it into a small satellite payload that is capable of producing cold atoms in space. Demonstrating this new technology in space is a vital first step towards realising real instruments that are capable of mapping tiny changes in the strength of gravity across the surface of the earth. The extreme sensitivity brought by cold atom sensors will provide the ability to finely monitor the movement of mass within earth systems. This has multiple applications including accurate monitoring of changes in polar ice mass, ocean currents and sea level. Higher resolution data will lead to the ability to monitor smaller water sources and new underground natural resources which are currently not detectable. Similar technology will also be used for deep space navigation and for providing higher precision timing sources in space.",EPSRC
EP/X035026/1,"Swansea University will use this equipment award from EPSRC too strategically invest in state of the art equipment in key areas across the Faculty of Science and Engineering within the remit of EPSRC. The primary objective of these interventions is to significantly enhance our ability to manufacture and characterise energy materials expanding both throughput and scale of the research. The equipment requested is a major extension of our current capabilities in particular in the fabrication of 3rd generation photovoltaics enabling enhanced device performance and complexity. 

The equipment has been carefully selected to fill major gaps in end-to-end fabrication and characterisation facilities for energy materials. This intervention will be of a major benefit to our sizeable research community enabling both higher performing and larger devices for study of behaviour and scale-up. This broader opportunity for scientific excellence will provide a benefit to both established research groups and for accelerating the careers of next generation researchers who will have open-access. The equipment has been carefully selected to augment, enhance and add value to the current research capabilities at the University. It will allow the creation of new fabrication and characterisation pathways, these new experimental methodologies will provide new insights, new data and improved quality of existing data. This, in turn, will lead to publication in high impact factor journals, create further opportunities for collaboration and growth of our networks through extensive public engagement and help leverage external funding to further grow and develop these areas.",EPSRC
AH/T003308/1,"Most of our cultural heritage is a product of family inheritance. The letters, diaries, and account books that fill archives, the artworks displayed on gallery walls, and the objects curated in museums often exist only because a family thought them an important inheritance that should be maintained and ultimately vested in our national institutions. Yet, why people hold onto particular objects or intangible inheritances, like stories, while discarding others, and the reasons why they choose to relegate something to an attic, or retrieve it again, are topics that scholars are only beginning to grapple with. New methodologies from the history and sociology of emotions that explore emotion as an analytical tool to explain and interpret behaviour offer fruitful approaches to these questions. 

This research network draws together scholars in history, sociology, literary studies, heritage, as well as family historians, to address the question of how and why family inheritances maintain their power, as they move across generations and from the private to the public spheres. This research is important because family inheritances - including those of intangible or low monetary value - are forms of economic, social and cultural capital that help shape outcomes for individuals and groups. 

Understanding how and why these inheritances are transmitted helps us explain why social mobility is possible for some groups and not others, and why certain types of family knowledge resist change, while others are adapted to accommodate new information and to suit new environments. In exploring the relationship between familial attachments and national heritage, this research also contributes to decision-making around collections and display in the heritage sector, and the ways that family histories inform the production of national memory and identity.",AHRC
NE/T008997/1,"Without robust age control, reconstructing the past dynamics of the Earth system in response to external forcing is problematic. Chronometry is a critical part of studying past environmenst, climates, ecology, human evolution and human landscape-use. Several excellent methods for dating ancient material exist. In many environmental contexts, however, optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is the only method than can be used, due to the nature of the sediments that preserve the environmental record. The Oxford laboratory has long-running research excellence in studying the last approximately 100,000 years of Earth's terrestrial history, specifically in African and other dryland regions, including Arabia, India and China. These studies have focused on changes in landscape conditions, including ancient lakes and rivers, and on questions of archaeology and human evolution, including responses to environmental change and mobility. The extent and conviction with which such studies can make conclusions is affected strongly by the quality and range of the chronology available. Having greater confidence in the dates derived from analysed sediments, and being able to extend the age range beyond what is currently possible, would allow a host of new research questions to be addressed that would greatly advance these fields. This includes establishing long (up to 1Ma) terrestrial records of climate change, much needed by both the archaeological and modelling communities, making major contributions to our understanding of both human prehistory, past climate changes and, ultimately improvements to model predictions of future climate change. 
Oxford has been a leader in luminescence dating development and applications for over 40 years. The new laboratory equipment, a VLS luminescence reader and complementary MiDose radiation measurement device, will provide state-of-the-art equipment that will enable new technical developments. VLS analysis facilitates investigation of a new method of measurement, allowing different dating signals to be observed, pushing the dating limit back beyond 1 million years of Earth's history - a significant improvement on current capabilities. Over time, the signals 'fill-up' due to exposure of the sampled sediments to natural background radiation. The signals typically used for optical dating fill-up over the course of around 100,000 years - and it is essential for accurate dating to know this 'filing rate'. The signals observable using the VLS equipment may take over 1 million years to fill, therefore extending our dating capabilities significantly beyond the reliable limits of 'traditional' OSL dating, allowing us to learn a great deal more about Earth's history and that of humans on the landscape over this period.
This would represent a step change in OSL applications, creating one of the first UK luminescence labs to date sediments back to &gt;1 million years via the luminescence reader with VLS attachment. MiDose provides the means to measure, in a sophisticated way, the various components of the natural background radiation dose rate of the samples, and therefore to calculate the 'filling rate' with greater confidence. This equipment will allow us to improve determination of both components of a luminescnce age, the accumulated dose and the dose rate. Together, this will provide the opportunity to answer for the first time long-standing environmental and archaeological questions These include, for example, testing climate model outputs with terrestrial evidence for large-scale hydroclimate drivers, and establishing the timing of ancestral human presence in drylands (many importnat ancestral modern human sites are in dryalnd regions), and greatly improving capabilities to reconstruct environmental variability over timescales &gt;100,000 years in environmental contexts where dating methods other than OSL cannot be applied.",NERC
ST/H001093/2,"The Large Hadron Collider will begin to deliver data in October 2009. The Cambridge group has participated in the construction of the ATLAS and LHCb detectors which will explore the physics progresses taking place in the 10 TeV energy regime opened up by the new collider. In ATLAS the group will be making measurements of expected processes like Z-boson production, in order to test whether the predictions of our current theories still hold at high energy. We will also be searching directly for the production of supersymmetric particles, predicted in many theoretical models, and for evidence of the existence of extra space dimensions. In LHCb, we will make measurements aimed at understanding the differences between matter and antimatter, and hence explaining why the Universe we live in appears to contain very little antimatter. In order to pursue this research we will need to work on the operation and calibration of the detector systems we work with. These include the tracking system in ATLAS, which measures the paths of particles, and the RICH detector in LHCb, which can distinguish between different particle types. Since the LHC will in future operate at a higher intensity, we also plan to develop detector technologies capable of working at much higher rates. In parallel, we will develop detector systems for future experiments. We also participate in the MINOS experiment, which studies the properties of neutrinos, and in particular their ability to transmute between neutrino types. We will complete our data analysis work on this experiment, to get the maximum return on the investment made to date.",STFC
BB/M028348/1,"Phoma stem canker, caused by the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans, is a damaging disease on oilseed rape in the UK, causing annual yield losses &gt; &pound;100M despite use of fungicides costing &pound;20M. With recent loss of the most effective fungicides (e.g. Punch C) through EU legislation and predicted global warming, potential yield losses will increase. Use of host resistance to control this disease is becoming ever more important. However, new sources of resistance are often rendered ineffective due to pathogen population changes. 
The aims of this project are to monitor the emergence of new virulent races of L. maculans and to develop new control strategies to increase durability of host resistance. 

 To maintain effectiveness of cultivar resistance against L. maculans, this project will use molecular technology to investigate the differences between different regions in distribution of virulent races of L. maculans in populations assessed from spore samples and from crop plant samples. Results will be used to guide deployment of cultivars with suitable resistance for the region where the corresponding avirulent pathogen races are predominant. 

 Resistance against L. maculans relies on major resistance (R) gene-mediated qualitative resistance and minor gene-mediated quantitative resistance. The fungus L. maculans has high evolutionary potential to overcome host resistance. Resistance can be rendered ineffective in 2-3 years due to L. maculans population changes from avirulent to virulent. This project will investigate the molecular events leading to virulent mutations in L. maculans by exploiting new genomic information about L. maculans. 

 Modelling work shows that the range and severity of phoma stem canker will increase under predicted global warming. To investigate the effects of environmental factors (e.g. temperature) on operation of different R genes for resistance against L. maculans, severity of phoma stem canker on cultivars with different R genes will be assessed in field experiments in different regions (i.e. different environments) and in controlled environment experiments at different temperatures. 

 Recent work showed that R gene-mediated resistance against L. maculans (an apoplastic pathogen) operates by recognition of pathogen effectors through receptor-like proteins (RLPs). The sequences of R genes stable at increased temperatures and the genome sequences of host Brassica napus and its related species B. rapa and B. oleracea will be used to identify candidate R genes coding for RLPs. 

 New knowledge obtained from this project will be used to develop strategies to improve control of phoma stem canker by using effective cultivar resistance. Improved control of this disease will benefit growers by reducing yield losses. It will also address the challenge of food security. The environment will also benefit from reduced use of fungicides.",BBSRC

EP/X025837/1,"Many important questions and grand challenges in research, industry, and society involve large and complex networks of chemical reactions. Some examples are: studying metabolic networks in humans; planning and optimizing chemical synthesis in industry and research labs; modeling the fragmentation process in mass spectrometry; developing personalized medicine; probing hypotheses of the origins of life; monitoring environmental pollution in air, water, and soil. 

In project TACsy, we will develop ground-breaking new computational methods for analyzing such networks of chemical reactions and we will train a new generation of excellent and innovative early stage researchers (ESRs) capable of evolving and applying these methods in research and industry. Combined, these efforts carry very strong potential for impact on the grand challenges mentioned above, on the EU commission priority on jobs, growth, investment, and competitiveness, and on the well-being of EU citizens. 

The research methodology of TACsy arises from the novel application of formalisms, algorithms, and computational methods from computer science to questions in systems chemistry. The first steps demonstrating the strong capabilities of this approach have recently been made. In TACsy, the ESRs will vastly expand these methods and their formal foundations, they will create efficient algorithms and implementations of them, and they will use these implementations for research in complex chemical systems in three flagship application areas. 

TACsy is a consortium of world-class, experienced scientists which will ensure excellent research training conditions for the ESRs in this highly interdisciplinary field.

BB/D013852/1,"Calcium plays a central role in all cells and tissues, so the monitoring of cellular calcium is of major importance in both life sciences research and drug development. The critical contribution of cell organelles (mitochondria or nucleus, for example) to the health of the cell has led to the development of methods in which calcium signals in these organelles can be measured. To this end, we have successfully developed calcium indicators (reporters) to track calcium events in organelles in living organisms (the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster). We have made the first fruitflies which express calcium reporters in the mitochondria. The mitochondria are powerhouses which generate energy for the cell, and calcium signals are an important part of this process. Malfunction of mitochondrial calcium has been implicated in many disease processes and as most cells have distinct populations of mitochondria, determining the specific function of these in intact tissue would be novel and useful. At a cellular level, fruitflies and humans are very similar; so the fruitfly is an excellent model in which to study mitochondrial calcium signalling in an intact tissue or animal. These studies will allow us to find out how calcium signalling processes in this important organelle affects tissue function in a non-disease situation.",BBSRC
BB/I00680X/1,"The World is faced with the considerable challenge of supplementing, and ultimately replacing, its fossil fuel-based economy with one based on clean energy technologies such as biofuels. Currently, commercially available biofuels (e.g. bioethanol and biodiesel) are derived from crop plants such as maize and soybean. However, there are major concerns regarding both the use of valuable agricultural land for production of biofuel crops, and the sustainability and energy balance of such technologies. A potential alternative source of biofuels is microalgae - aquatic photosynthetic organisms that do not require fertile land for cultivation; grow considerably faster than plants, and which can accumulate significant quantities of high-energy compounds such as oils. Furthermore, such aquatic cultivation could be coupled to waste streams such as CO2 output from industry and nutrient-rich effluent, thereby using this waste to promote algal growth. However, industrial-scale cultivation of microalgae for biofuels faces considerable challenges, not just in terms of technical feasibility, but also in terms of the economics and achieving a net positive energy balance. It is recognised that success will probably require the development of superior algal strains in which genetic engineering methods have been used to radically alter and tailor the cell metabolism's towards maximal biofuel productivity under industrial conditions. Currently, the molecular tools needed to create such strains are decided limited and algal metabolic engineering is still in its infancy. In this project, we will develop advanced tools for algae along the lines of the 'synthetic biology' technology now being used to design and create novel bacterial and yeast strains. A particularly, attractive feature of our approach is that we will exploit the ability to introduce new genes into two separate genetic compartments, the nucleus and the chloroplast, thereby allowing elaborate strategies for engineering that employ multiple new genes and create novel biosynthetic pathways within the chloroplast, but which can regulated from the nucleus. We will validate this new technology by creating a series of designer algae that produce two potentially useful fuel molecules - the short-chain hydrocarbon, isoprene and the alcohol, geraniol.",BBSRC
BB/R003629/1,"With age, it is unfortunate that humans succumb to a variety of debilitating conditions e.g. brain degeneration, diabetes, heart problems and muscle degeneration to name but four. However, it is difficult to study ageing in humans due to the time scales involved. To circumvent this problem, scientists use simpler organisms such as worms, flies and mice. In particular, studies with a nematode worm (Latin name C. elegans) have been instrumental to discovering and understanding the ageing process. For example, it is possible to increase or decrease lifespan in worms by altering the activity of various molecules and amazingly, interventions that extend lifespan often also improve the age-related health of the animals. Thus, these studies have shown that it is possible not only to extend lifespan but also the quality of life. As most of the molecules identified in this research are also present in human cells, by studying their effects on lifespan in simple organisms, we will eventually be able to use this information to design approaches to slow ageing and improve the late-life health of humans.

In worms, one important ageing molecule is called SKN-1. It is equivalent (in terms of its function) to the human Nrf proteins. If SKN-1 activity is decreased then worms have a shorter lifespan and, conversely if SKN-1 activity is increased so is their lifespan. Understanding how SKN-1 works is therefore key to understanding the ageing process and developing ways to intervene in it. SKN-1/Nrf has a very important role in cells because it allows them to respond to and survive stressful conditions. It is also very important for regulating protein homeostasis and metabolism. We want to understand how these and other functions are important for controlling ageing and as the SKN-1 molecules present in worms are similar to those in humans, our work has real relevance to a better understanding of human ageing.

There is currently considerable interest in identifying genetic or chemical modulators to extend lifespan and thus improve lifelong health. We know that SKN-1 is important for these processes and, it is particularly interesting to study as it is already an established drug target. So, by defining how it works we will be able to harness this to develop anti-ageing therapies and therefore lay the foundations of knowledge that will be useful for promoting long and healthy human lives.",BBSRC
ES/T015926/1,"The proposed project follows on from the Consuming Urban Poverty Project, which sought to alleviate poverty through the governance of food systems in secondary cities in Africa. While the project was able to demonstrate some impact on local government officials attitudes towards urban food systems, and engage in the shaping of global urban food policies and programmes, the project team realised that to increase commitment to addressing urban food issues in the interest of poverty alleviation it was essential to target external actors who play a pivotal role in shaping local government policy and planning. 
The project identified three key issues limiting action at the local government scale that can only be addressed by working with external actors. The first was that there was deeply entrenched thinking from planners which hindered pro-poor food planning. Planners no sense of how to act differently, and limited formal training opportunities. The project found limited engagement in food issues by powerful informal economy advocacy groups. Finally, it found a strong bias against informality amongst policy makers, which was unchallenged the global discourses on urban food governance as found in the SDGs, New Urban Agenda and documents from various UN Agencies. Therefore, a three-pronged strategy to affect change in planning, policy through civil society advocacy and global policy discourses.
The project has three packages of work aimed to address the key problems identified. 
The first work package seeks to enhance current and future planners' capacity to incorporate urban food systems into planning in Africa. This will be achieved through the development of a podcast series targeting planners and other urban professionals. The podcast series will be supported by a website that will host links to relevant materials and potentially an interactive platform for engagement, as well as teaching guide for academics to enable them to use the podcasts within the classroom environment. These will be disseminated through the African Centre for Cities, Moving on Empty and Urban Africa social media platforms as well as through LinkedIn groups, through the Association of African Planning Schools network, through the African Urban Research Initiative network, and through the FAO's Food for Cities network. The project will also specifically target academic departments that have demonstrated potential to incorporate urban food into planning and other curricula, as well as the CUP project partner institutions.
The second work package seeks to get food onto the informal sector advocacy agenda, through production and dissemination of four policy briefs on the role of food in the informal sector and possible points for advocacy. These will be disseminated to global informal sectors advocacy groups through the Consuming Urban Poverty Project's existing relationships with WIEGO and StreetNet.
The third work package seeks to shift global discourse through strategic engagement with key actors shaping discourse and policy direction. This is a refinement of the approach taken in the CUP project in its meeting hosted at Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Centre. The proposed project will host meetings in Washington, New York, Minneapolis, Rome, London and Waterloo, Canada for the key individuals shaping global urban food policy discourse, as identified within the CUP project. These meetings, together with targeted dissemination of project findings and perspectives, will seek to incorporate greater consideration of the relationship between formal and informal components of the food system, urban and sub-urban scale planning for food security, and governance mandates.
The project will also use the City of Cape Town as a testing ground for project materials and perspectives, building on existing long-term relationships between project partners and the City and the City's new Resilience Strategy which commits to establishing a food systems programme.",ESRC

EP/V008617/1,"Optical coatings are key components within almost all technology that surrounds us from our glasses to cameras. Extreme-performance coatings are used in optical atomic clocks and gravitaitonal-wave detectors which are the most sensitive clocks and distance meters ever built. Optical coatings are also essential for industrial applications in photonics, particularly for miniaturisation of laser diode devices and for increasing the laser damage threshold.

Optical coatings consist of alternating layers of materials with different refractive indices and are only a few micrometers thick. Their performance is determined by the amount of light scattered and absorbed inside the coating and by their thermal noises caused by the Brownian motion of the atoms. Optical coatings can be manufactured out of a large variety of materials, such as tantalum oxide, silica, and amorphous silicon. However, the ultimate properties of the coatings depend both on the intrinsic properties of these materials and on the manufacturing process. Therefore, it is essential to have a robust experiment to test novel coatings for precision instruments.

We propose to build an internationally-leading facility to directly measure the properties of novel optical coatings. This proposal emanates from two recent findings. First, the MIT LIGO group found that coating samples can be measured in one week using a multimode optical resonator. Second, groups in academia in the UK, USA, and Germany developed a new class of promising extreme-performance coatings for applications in precision measurements. The proposed centre is a crucial step in commercial manufacturing of high-quality coatings since we need to experimentally explore the whole parameter space of coating production, such as deposition rate, doping materials, and annealing temperature.

The key idea of the proposed experiment is to embed a coating sample in the optical resonator and measure its properties using three co-resonating beams. This setup will make all displacement noises common to these beams, except for the coating thermal noises. The main advantage of the proposed facility is that it can test one coating sample per week at the telecom laser wavelength and has the potential to be the first in the world working with extreme-performance coatings in this parameter space. The centre will be able to directly measure coating samples for future optical atomic clocks, next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, fundamental physics experiments and for the commercial applications.",EPSRC
EP/S031480/1,"The traditional approach to construction is notorious for poor productivity and inadequate contribution to economic development (ONS, 2017). With the aim of boosting productivity, the construction sector must transform its methods of construction and adopt effective digital technologies (TIP, 2017). The adoption of BIM has transformed the way buildings are designed and enhanced the implementation of building manufacturing technologies such as Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA). However, the adoption of BIM by onsite frontline workers for assembly of manufactured building components is non-existent. This results in loss of the productivity gain from using BIM for design and manufacturing phases of the process (BCI, 2016). Onsite frontline workers spend more time interfacing with BIM tools than they spend on completing the actual assembly tasks. Current BIM interfaces are not practicable for onsite operations because they are too slow, hazardous and distracting for onsite frontline workers (Construction News, 2017). On this basis, the research will introduce advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Conversational Artificial-Intelligence for enabling onsite frontline workers to verbally communicate with BIM systems. 

Assembly operations are complex and are often complicated by the uniqueness of each project, the inconsistency of assembly methods, and the diversity and alterations of project team. During onsite assembly operations, onsite frontline workers are required to quickly understand the procedure of installing building components to minimise assembly errors and reduce the overall project duration. The time spent by frontline workers can be reduced by 50% with the introduction of hands-free assembly support BIM system that utilises verbal communication. In addition to boosting productivity, it will further enhance error-free assembly operation through step-by-by assembly guide for pre-manufactured/pre-assembled building components.

The development of technologies to aid easy adoption of BIM for onsite assembly has great potential to revolutionise the current approach to construction. However, apart from the slow pace and hazardous nature of current BIM interfaces, other limitations include visual obstruction, distraction and the associated health and safety challenge for frontline workers. 

This project aims to utilise Augmented Reality (AR) for providing visual support to access BIM systems and installation guides without obstructing or distracting the view of onsite workers. This will provide accurate and just-in-time information for online frontline workers to gradually follow the installation guide of manufactured building components. For example, an onsite assembly worker can merely ask, &quot;hey Conversational-BIM, guide me through toilet installation&quot; and the system will facilitate the assembly procedures through AR-assisted verbal instructions, the AR device will overlay the exact illustration of the assembly steps on the actual components onsite. 

It is important to note that onsite coordination between resources is vital for boosting productivity and guaranteeing faster and safer assembly (ICE, 2018). This project will therefore exploit advanced AI, computer visions, and AR technologies to develop an end-to-end BIM solution to support onsite assembly operations. In addition to boosting the productivity of frontline assembly workers, this project seeks to eliminate the tedious process of coordinating onsite activities which often involve multiple workers and machinery. Accordingly, the AR-assisted Conversational-BIM system will ensure a coordinated approach for remote experts to guide frontline workers and monitor project progress and productivity.",ISCF
EP/L02327X/1,"Summary of research for a general audience 

One of the most exciting frontiers of science is the study of phenomena that take place on the timescale of attoseconds (as, 10^-18 s). To imagine such an incredibly short period of time, consider that light travels from here to the moon in one second, but only travels 0.0003mm in one femtosecond (fs, 10^-15 s). To put it in context, that is about 1/300th the width of a human hair in 10^-15 s (or 1000 as). Attoseconds are the timescales on which atomic processes/transitions occur - for example, an electron circles the hydrogen atom in ~24 as (the so called 'atomic unit of time'). 

To investigate, and in future control, the dynamics of such ultrafast processes measurement tools of unprecedented quality and precision are required - pulses of light with attosecond duration. This is much shorter than a single cycle of any visible light wave (violet~1.3fs, red~2.5fs), requiring instead extreme-ultraviolet (XUV)/ X-ray radiation to be controlled with clinical accuracy to achieve ultrashort durations. However, the pay-off for this effort is substantial; researchers can investigate the microcosm with a degree of spatial clarity and on shorter time scales than previously possible, thus allowing them to see events that are ordinarily 'blurred' using conventional XUV/X-ray sources such as synchrotrons.

Attosecond pulses must be synthesized using wavelengths shorter than those in the visible region of the spectrum and therein lies a significant problem - wavelengths shorter than the visible spectrum i.e. ultraviolet and X-rays, are strongly absorbed in most materials. It is therefore impossible to build an attosecond laser using conventional laser building techniques. Instead next generation methods are required. Two principle media are currently being studied at laser laboratories around the world - intense laser-gas interactions and relativistic laser plasmas formed using solid density targets - for the production of attosecond pulses.

In the proposed research we focus on the second medium - relativistic laser plasma. The underlying mechanism under investigation for the generation of intense attosecond pulses is the production of relativistic electron nanobunches during high power optical laser interactions with ultrathin carbon foils. This novel concept is based on our recent work showing that dense bunches of electrons with sub 10nm scale (nm = nanometer = 10^-9m) can be formed and rapidly accelerated on the front surface by the relativistically intense driving laser field and subsequently emerge from the rear surface of ultrathin carbon foils. Two resulting mechanisms will be studied in detail in this research - Coherent Synchrotron Emission (CSE) and Relativistic Electron Mirrors (REM). Only recently demonstrated, CSE and REM offer a novel window onto the relativistic laser plasma interaction and our work will not only reveal the microscopic dynamics of these mechanisms but also show a direct path to the generation of bright attosecond pulses.",EPSRC
