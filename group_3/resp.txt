ðŸ§  CLAUDE'S REASONING:
   This ticket shows strong similarity to historical tickets 1, 2, and 5 (all Python environment issues with ModuleNotFoundError patterns), suggesting a common Python environment or package installation problem. The user (Alexis) is experiencing issues with geospatial analytics in Python, which typically involves specialized libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, Rasterio, or similar packages. The frustrated tone ('just NOT working?!') indicates they've likely attempted basic troubleshooting. Given the pattern from similar tickets, this is most likely a missing package/dependency issue or environment configuration problem. The issue affects one researcher (individual impact), has no stated deadline urgency, and appears to be a standard software configuration issue rather than a system-wide problem. Applications Support team is best positioned as they handle Python environments, software installation, and user guidance - matching the expertise needed for geospatial Python libraries.

âš¡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   1. Contact Alexis to gather specific error messages and Python environment details
   2. Identify which geospatial libraries they're attempting to use (GeoPandas, Shapely, etc.)
   3. Check their current Python environment and module availability on their system
